// The following app I have made is a calorie tracker. it allows you to enter any item with a value, and the date
// ... is automatically added and averaged in the other view. there is also a notes page for recipes or calorie/per/gram totals
// ... There are also some presets I coded for foods i commonly eat in a day to save time. users can also delete entries
// ... and all daily totals are summed and shown in the daily total view
